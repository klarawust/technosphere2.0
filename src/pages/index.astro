    <p>
      Hello, my name is Klara. Originally from Oslo, I am a developer and
      designer who has studied in Trondheim and Oslo. I received my B. Sc Degree
      from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in 2024 and I am
      currently working on my M. Sc in Design, Use and Interaction at the
      University of Oslo. I am also taking some classes in Media and
      Communication on the side. During my time at NTNU in Trondheim, I
      valunteered in the Business-committee, getting a insight into the
      cooperation between a large student-organisation and the corperate world.
      My design philosophy stems from a deeply rooted belief that impactful
      design requires truly listening to the people and their needs. I am
      especially interested in exploring alternative approaches to dwelling,
      adaptive reuse and innovative, and ultimately, how software can improve
      the daily lives of its inhabitants.
