      Hi, I'm Klara, a developer originally from Oslo. I'm currently studying in
      Trondheim and will be graduating with a B. Sc. degree from the Norwegian
      University of Science and Technology in 2024. During my time at NTNU in
      Trondheim, I volunteered in the Business Committee, gaining insights into
      the collaboration between a student organization and various IT companies.
      I enjoy keeping busy with programming projects, spending time with friends
      and family, and pursuing my hobbies. Stay tuned for updates on my personal
      website!
