      Hi, I'm Klara, a developer originally from Oslo. I recently graduated with
      a B. Sc degree in Informatics from the Norwegian University of Science and
      Technology in Trondheim. I enjoy spending time with friends and familiy,
      going to caf√©s, bars, eat out and visiting exibitions and theaters. I also
      like keeping busy with programming projects and pursuing my hobbies, like
      knitting, reading and other crafts. Stay tuned for updates here on my
      personal website!
